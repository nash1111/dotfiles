# Introduction to Revise

`Revise.jl` may help you keep your Julia sessions running longer, reducing the
need to restart when you make changes to code.
With Revise, you can be in the middle of a session and then edit source code,
update packages, switch git branches, and/or stash/unstash code;
typically, the changes will be incorporated into the very next command you issue from the REPL.
This can save you the overhead of restarting, loading packages, and waiting for code to JIT-compile.

## Installation

You can obtain Revise using Julia's Pkg REPL-mode (hitting `]` as the first character of the command prompt):

```julia
(v0.7) pkg> add Revise
```

or with `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Revise")`.

## Usage example

```julia
(v0.7) pkg> dev Example
[...output related to installation...]

julia> using Revise        # importantly, this must come before `using Example`

julia> using Example

julia> hello("world")
"Hello, world"

julia> Example.f()
ERROR: UndefVarError: f not defined

julia> edit(hello)   # opens Example.jl in the editor you have configured

# Now, add a function `f() = π` and save the file

julia> Example.f()
π = 3.1415926535897...
```

Revise is not tied to any particular editor.
(The [EDITOR or JULIA_EDITOR](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/InteractiveUtils/#InteractiveUtils.edit-Tuple{AbstractString,Integer}) environment variables can be used to specify your preference.)

See [Using Revise by default](@ref) if you want Revise to be available every time you
start julia.

## What Revise can track

Revise is fairly ambitious: if all is working you should be able to track changes to

- any package that you load with `import` or `using`
- any script you load with [`includet`](@ref)
- any file defining `Base` julia itself (with `Revise.track(Base)`)
- any file defining `Core.Compiler` (with `Revise.track(Core.Compiler)`)
- any of Julia's standard libraries (with, e.g., `using Unicode; Revise.track(Unicode)`)

The last two require that you clone Julia and build it yourself from source.

## Secrets of Revise "wizards"

Revise can assist with methodologies like
[test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
While it's often desirable to write the test first, sometimes when fixing a bug
it's very difficult to write a good test until you understand the bug better.
Often that means basically fixing the bug before your write the test.
With Revise, you can

- fix the bug while simultaneously developing a high-quality test
- verify that your test passes with the fixed code
- `git stash` your fix and check that your new test fails on the old code,
  thus verifying that your test captures the essence of the former bug (if it doesn't fail,
  you need a better test!)
- `git stash pop`, test again, commit, and submit

all without restarting your Julia session.

## What else do I need to know?

Except in cases of problems (see below), that's it!
Revise is a tool that runs in the background, and when all is well it should be
essentially invisible, except that you don't have to restart Julia so often.

Revise can also be used as a "library" by developers who want to add other new capabilities
to Julia; the sections [How Revise works](@ref) and [Developer reference](@ref) are
particularly relevant for them.

## If Revise doesn't work as expected

If Revise isn't working for you, here are some steps to try:

- See [Configuration](@ref) for information on customization options.
  In particular, some file systems (like NFS) might require special options.
- Revise can't handle all kinds of code changes; for more information,
  see the section on [Limitations](@ref).
- Try running `test Revise` from the Pkg REPL-mode.
  If tests pass, check the documentation to make sure you understand how Revise should work.
  If they fail (especially if it mirrors functionality that you need and isn't working), see
  [Fixing a broken or partially-working installation](@ref) for some suggestions.

If you still encounter problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl/issues).
Especially if you think Revise is making mistakes in adding or deleting methods, please
see the page on [Debugging Revise](@ref) for information about how to attach logs
to your bug report.
