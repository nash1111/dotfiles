# [Scales](@id lib_scale)

Scales, similarly to Statistics, apply a transformation to the original
data, typically mapping one aesthetic to the same aesthetic, while retaining
the original value. For example, the Scale.x_log10 aesthetic maps the
 `x` aesthetic back to the `x` aesthetic after applying a log10 transformation,
but keeps track of the original value so that data points are properly
identified.
