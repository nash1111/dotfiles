# Ratios

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timholy/Ratios.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timholy/Ratios.jl)

This package provides types similar to Julia's `Rational` type, which make some sacrifices but have better computational performance.

Currently the only type provided is `SimpleRatio(num, den)` for two integers `num` and `den`.
